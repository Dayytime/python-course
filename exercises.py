# exercise 1
# give the values for the following expressions

print(9 - 3)
# 6
print(8 * 2.5)
# 20.0
print(9 / 2)
# 4.5
print(9 / -2)
# -4.5
print(9 // -2)
# -4 ???
print(9.0 % 2)
# 1.0
print(9 % 2.0)
# 1.0
print(9 % -2)
# -1
print(-9 % 2)
# 1
print(9 / -2.0)
# -4.5
print(4 + 3 * 5)
# 19
print((4 + 3) * 5)
# 35

# exercise 2
# what is the output of the following?
x = -17
print(+x)
# the output is -17 because -17 * 1 = -17

# exercise 3

temp = 24
temp = temp * 1.8 +32
print(temp)

# exercise 4
# for each of the following expressions, in which order are the subexpressions evaluated?

# 6 * 3 + 7 * 4
# * then +

# 5 + 3 / 4
# / then +

# 5 - 2 * 3 ** 4
# * then - then **

# exercise 5
x = 10.5
y = 4
x = x + y
print(x)
# result is 14.5

# exercise 6
# write a description of what happens when python evaluates the statement x+=x-x when x has the value of 3
# python does x - x which is 3 - 3
# then python runs x+= 0 which gives the output of 3
# 3 is then assigned to x

# exercise 7
print(d)

# exercise 8
# 8 = people (b)
# 4+= 7/2 (e)
